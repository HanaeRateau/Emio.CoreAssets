    Args:
        W: compliance matrix (size of 7 by 7)
        dq_free: free motion vector (size of 7)
        iE: indices of the effector in the system (W and dq_free)
        iA: indices of the actuators in the system (W and dq_free)
        q_s: position (x,y,z) of the sensor (real marker)

        q_e: position (x,y,z) of the effector in the simulation (simulation marker)
        q_a: current displacement (angle in randian) of the motors (d0, d1, d2, d3)
